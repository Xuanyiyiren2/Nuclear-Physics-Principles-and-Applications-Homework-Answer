    "\n",
    "Fusion reactions are nuclear processes in which two light atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a significant amount of energy. These reactions power the sun and other stars. There are several types of fusion reactions, but the most commonly studied and promising for practical energy production include:\n",
    "\n",
    "For further study, the Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) fusion reaction is the most practical choice. The reasons for this choice include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher Energy Output: The D-T reaction produces 17.6 MeV of energy, which is higher than other fusion reactions.\n",
    "Lower Temperature Requirements: It achieves significant reaction rates at temperatures lower than those needed for D-D or other fusion reactions.\n",
    "Abundant Fuel Sources: Deuterium is abundantly available in seawater, and tritium can be bred from lithium, making the fuel supply relatively sustainable​ (Energy.gov)​.\n",
    "In summary, the D-T fusion reaction is the most promising for practical energy production due to its high energy yield, lower temperature requirements, and the relative abundance of its fuel sources."
