The outstanding features of this system are shown in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The higher moderator density makes it possible to minimize the fuel rod pitch and enable a compact reactor core design.\n",
    "- The absence of bulk boiling in the core limits cladding corrosion and thereby increases the fuel reliability.\n",
    "The open-lattice fuel assembly design contributes to the economical use of neutrons and results in excellent fuel economy.\n",
    "- The self-control mechanisms are inherent, and a safe shutdown capability is ensured by gravity insertion of control rods in an emergency.\n",
    "- The plant generates an extremely low quantity of radioactive substance.\n",
    "- The reactor and turbine systems are separated by steam generators; therefore, the turbine system design of the combustion power plant grade is feasible and thereby it can be easily operated and maintained.\n",
    "- The core cooling with heat-removal capability of the secondary system ensures inherent reactor safety in an emergency.\n",
    "- The lower center-of-gravity plant design favors seismic resistance.\n",
