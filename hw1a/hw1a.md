# Question 1

Describe the Rutherford alpha scattering experiment in detail. What did he and his students observe, and what conclusions did they give?  What is the impact of Rutherford’s conclusions on the structures of atoms?

## Answer

In the Rutherford alpha scattering experiment conducted in 1909, Rutherford bombarded a gold foil with $\alpha$ particles ($^{4}\mathrm{He}$ nucleus) with $4.8\mathrm{MeV}$ and measured the differential scattering cross-section, which represents the distribution of the directions of outgoing particles.

The results revealed that approximately $\frac{1}{20000}$ of the $\alpha$ particles had been scattered at an angle greater than $90\degree$. This finding contradicted Thomson's plum pudding model. Consequently, Rutherford deduced that the majority of the mass was concentrated in a minute, positively-charged region known as the nucleus, surrounded by electrons.

The significance of the Rutherford alpha scattering experiment extends beyond its contribution to the modern atomic model. Its methodology, involving the firing of a particle beam at a target nucleus, is widely employed in contemporary particle experiments. This groundbreaking experiment not only unveiled the true nature of nuclei and atoms but also paved the way for advancements in particle physics."

# Question 2

Both the hertz and the curie have dimensions of $s^{-1}$. Explain the difference between these two units.

## Answer

Both hertz ( $\mathrm{Hz}$ ) and curie ( $\mathrm{Ci}$ ) both describe how many events happen per second. However, they measure different phenomena. Hertz is used for frequency, indicating cycles or oscillations per second in wave theory and electromagnetics. Curie measures the radioactive decay rate of atomic nuclei in materials. The relationship between of the two units is
$$
1\,\mathrm{Ci}=3.7\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{Hz}
$$

# Question 3

Explain the $\mathrm{SI}$ errors (if any) in and give the correct equivalent units for the following units: (a) m-grams/pL, (b) megaohms/nm, (c) Bq/milli-Curie.

- (a) is wrong because it mixes unit names and symbols and put hyphens between unit names. The right one is $\mathrm{mg/pL}$ .
- (b) is wrong because it mixes unit names and leaves the double vowels. The right should be $\mathrm{M\ohm s/nm}$ .
- (c) is wrong because it mixes unit names and symbols and put hyphens between unit names. The right should be $\mathrm{Bq/mCi}$. But it is a little awkward because $\mathrm{Bq}$ and $\mathrm{Ci}$ describe the same physical quantity, the radioactive decay rate. Thus they should never appear together.

# Question  4

Assuming that a nucleus is a sphere of nuclear matter of radius $1.2\times A^{1/ 3}\, \mathrm{fm}$, express the average nuclear density in SI units.

## Answer

The mass of the nucleus is about $A\times 1\mathrm{u}$. Thus the density of nucleus is
$$
\frac{A\times 1\mathrm{u}}{4\pi (1.2\times A^{1/3}\mathrm{fm})^3/3}=2.294\times10^{17}\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}
$$

# Question 5

How many neutrons and protons are there in each of the following nuclides: (a) $^{10}\mathrm{B}$ (b) $^{24}\mathrm{Na}$, (c) $^{59}\mathrm{Co}$.

## Answer

| Atoms | # neutron | # proton |
| :-----: | :-------: | :------: |
| $^{10}\mathrm{B}$ | 5 | 5 |
| $^{24}\mathrm{Na}$ | 13 | 11 |
| $^{59}\mathrm{Co}$ | 32 | 27 |

# Question 6

What’s the principle of  a Crookes tube?

## Answer

A Crookes tube is an early experimental electrical discharge tube. It consists of a evacuated tube and two metal electrodes. When a high voltage is applied between the electrodes, the cathode rays are projected from the cathode.
